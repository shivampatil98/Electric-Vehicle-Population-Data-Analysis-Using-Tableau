# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data-Analysis-Using-Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) population data to uncover trends, adoption patterns, and insights about the growth of electric mobility.
Using structured data analysis and interactive visualization, the project explores how EV adoption varies across regions, model types, manufacturers, and time.

The goal of this project is to transform raw EV registration data into meaningful insights that can support policy decisions, infrastructure planning, and market understanding.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze EV population growth trends
- Identify top manufacturers and vehicle models
- Examine geographic distribution of EV adoption
- Compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)
- Create interactive dashboards for data exploration

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning and analysis)
- Tableau (for interactive visualization)
- CSV dataset for EV population records

## 🔍 Insights

- EV adoption shows consistent year-over-year growth.
- Certain manufacturers dominate the EV market.
- Battery Electric Vehicles are growing faster than Plug-in Hybrids in recent years.
- Adoption is concentrated in specific urban regions.
